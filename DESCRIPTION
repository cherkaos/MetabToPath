Description: Use name or other id (pubchem, keggâ€¦) to find in which pathways a metabolite is from. Query different databases such as: Kegg, SMPDB, HMDB and Biocyc. Also include functions for batch query to find every pathway from different database, for each metabolite of a list. Can query specific databases (kegg) to find the pathway who has the most metabolite from query.  Also, can output result in latex and csv.
